I have learnt how to veiw Git history using the command "git log"
I have learnt how to create and merge git branch using the following command:
* git branch : displays branches on your current reposotories.
* git branch new-branch : create a new branch  
* git branch -D new-branch : Delete a branch 
* git checkout new-branch : to switch to a branch you want to work on
* git checkout -b another-branch : to create a new branch and switch to the new branch 
* git merge new-branch : merges the branch new-branch into current active branch
